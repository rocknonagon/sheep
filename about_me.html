            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I'm a stay-at-home mum and I like reading picture books to my son.</p>
            <p>So I guess I just have picture books in my mind and wanted to try to 
            make a website that tells a story.</p>
            <p>If you move from the first page across to the right, and hover over the
                top half of each page, an image of Buzz the sheep should appear, with a dialogue. 
                As you move past the animals, they turn to you.
            Then once you reach the end, the previous panels change.
            Then if you go back the crocodile should follow you.</p>
            <p></p>
                <p>Hit the reset button to begin the story again (this is implemented
                in JavaScript).</p>
                <p>There's definitely some things I would change about the page if I had more time,
                but I hope it works okay for you. Thanks.</p>
